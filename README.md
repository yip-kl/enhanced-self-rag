# Multi-agent Enhanced Self-RAG

Source code for demonstrating how to add human reasoning to RAG application.

The code takes [LangGraph's Self-RAG tutorial](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/rag/langgraph_self_rag/) as a foundation, but significantly modified to enhance its capability.
